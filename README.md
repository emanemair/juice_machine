# juice_machine

A new fruit juice machine has been purchased for the cafeteria, and a program is needed
to make the machine function properly. The machine dispenses apple juice, orange
juice, mango lassi, and fruit punch in recyclable containers. In this programming
example, we write a program for the fruit juice machine so that it can be put into
operation.

## The program should do the following:
### 1. Show the customer the different products sold by the juice machine.
### 2. Let the customer make the selection.
### 3. Show the customer the cost of the item selected.
### 4. Accept money from the customer.
### 5. Release the item


<strong > Input : </strong> The item selection and the cost of the item. <br/> 
<strong > Output :  </strong> The selected item
