# juice_machine

A new fruit juice machine has been purchased for the cafeteria, and a program is needed
to make the machine function properly. The machine dispenses apple juice, orange
juice, mango lassi, and fruit punch in recyclable containers. In this repository 
we write a program for the fruit juice machine so that it can be put into
operation.

## The program should do the following:
### 1. Show the customer the different products sold by the juice machine.
### 2. Let the customer make the selection.
### 3. Show the customer the cost of the item selected.
### 4. Accept money from the customer.
### 5. Release the item


<strong > Input : </strong> The item selection and the cost of the item. <br/> 
<strong > Output :  </strong> The selected item 


A juice machine has two main components:<strong>  a built-in cash register </strong> and<strong>  several
dispensers </strong>  to hold and release the products. 


<strong> the  properties of a cash register. </strong> <br/> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;  The cash register has some cash on
hand, it accepts the amount from the customer, and if the amount deposited is more
&nbsp; &nbsp; than the cost of the item, then—if possible—the cash register returns the change.
&nbsp; &nbsp;For simplicity, we assume that the user deposits at least the amount of money for the
&nbsp; &nbsp;product. The cash register should also be able to show the juice machine’s owner
&nbsp; &nbsp;the amount of money in the register at any given time. The following class defines the
&nbsp; &nbsp;properties of a cash register.
 you can find the declration and implementation of cashRegister class in (cash_register.h and imp.cpp)  file  <br/> 

<strong> the  properties of a dispenser. </strong> <br/> 
The dispenser releases the selected item if it is not empty. The dispenser functionality : 
1.show the number of items in the dispenser and the cost of the item.
2. decrease the number of product item once the customer make a sale process
