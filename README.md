# juice_machine

A new fruit juice machine has been purchased for the cafeteria, and a program is needed
to make the machine function properly. The machine dispenses apple juice, orange
juice, mango lassi, and fruit punch in recyclable containers. In this repository 
we write a program for the fruit juice machine so that it can be put into
operation.

## The program should do the following:
### 1. Show the customer the different products sold by the juice machine.
### 2. Let the customer make the selection.
### 3. Show the customer the cost of the item selected.
### 4. Accept money from the customer.
### 5. Release the item


<strong > Input : </strong> The item selection and the cost of the item. <br/> 
<strong > Output :  </strong> The selected item 


A juice machine has two main components:<strong>  a built-in cash register </strong> and<strong>  several
dispensers </strong>  to hold and release the products. 


<strong> the  properties of a cash register. </strong> <br/> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp &nbsp The cash register has some cash on
hand, it accepts the amount from the customer, and if the amount deposited is more
than the cost of the item, then—if possible—the cash register returns the change.
For simplicity, we assume that the user deposits at least the amount of money for the
product. The cash register should also be able to show the juice machine’s owner
the amount of money in the register at any given time. The following class defines the
properties of a cash register.
