# Juice Machine

Welcome to the Juice Machine repository! This program is designed to operate a new fruit juice machine in the cafeteria. The machine dispenses a variety of delicious beverages, including apple juice, orange juice and mango lassi, all in recyclable containers. With this program, you can easily manage and enjoy your favorite juices hassle-free.

## Program Features

The Juice Machine program provides the following essential functionalities:

1. Display the available juice products to the customer.
2. Allow the customer to select their desired juice.
3. Show the cost of the selected item.
4. Accept payment from the customer.
5. Dispense the chosen juice.

**Input:** The customer's item selection and the cost of the item.  
**Output:** The selected juice product.

## Key Components

The Juice Machine consists of two main components: a built-in cash register and multiple dispensers for holding and releasing the juice products.

### Cash Register

The cash register is responsible for managing the financial aspect of the juice machine. It handles the following tasks:

- Maintaining a cash balance.
- Accepting payment from customers.
- Calculating and returning change if the payment exceeds the item's cost.
- Providing the current cash balance to the machine's owner.

You can find the declaration and implementation of the `cashRegister` class in the `cash_register.h` and `imp.cpp` files.

### Dispenser

The dispenser is responsible for managing the availability and sale of juice products. Its functions include:

1. Displaying the number of items in the dispenser and the item's cost.
2. Reducing the quantity of available items after a sale.

You can find the declaration and implementation of the `dispenserType` class in the `dispenser_type.h` and `imp.cpp` files.

## How the Program Works

When you run the program, it follows these steps:

1. Displays the available juice products to the customer.
2. Waits for the customer to make a selection.
3. Validates the selection and checks if the corresponding dispenser is not empty.
4. If the selection is valid and there are products available, the program completes the sale.

Enjoy your freshly squeezed juice with the Juice Machine program! :)
